# AXL-chatbot
I wanted to create a chatbot that could be implemented in a robot, but the ones I found were either very robotic or very slow, so I tried to create one that met my needs.


it's still very rough, but it's starting to look like what i want,

this project uses an ollama model to ensure conversation




the project is divided into several files:


the concsiousness_1.0.py file is the main program you can run directly, if you just want it to work without wanting to understand how it works




the functions_pause2.py file contains all the functions you can call up if you want to tweak things a bit

the question-answers.txt file contains all LLM questions and answers, to ensure optimum response speed to questions that have already been asked



and the rest of the files enable object recognition to function, so if you just want to test the camera, don't hesitate to try the obect_recognition.py program.
